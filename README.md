  - **Self-note:** Maybe `cheat` / `tldr` tool is better than this.
  - **Self-note #2:** Self hosting notes could be a good idea. Also with some neovim tools I could just "connect" to my notes from *anywhere* on *any* device that supports neovim (Windows 10+, Linux, MacOS, Android using Termux) which sounds awesome. Maybe this is promising? [sourcegraph/sg.nvim](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sg.nvim) (previously [tjdevries/sg.nvim](https://github.com/tjdevries/sg.nvim) )
