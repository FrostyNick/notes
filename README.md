  - Self-note: Maybe cheat / tldr tool is better than this.
  - Self-note #2: Self hosting notes could be a good idea. Also with some neovim tools I could just "connect" to my notes from *anywhere* on *any* device that supports neovim (Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android using Termux) which sounds awesome. There's already a plugin out there that connects to files from Neovim from this Neovim maintainer that I can't say from the top of my head.
